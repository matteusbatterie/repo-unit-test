## Introduction
The purpose of this project is building a POC (Proof of Concept) where some strategies for Unit Testing repositories in .NET Web APIs can be experimented.

## Technologies
As far as the development has progressed, I've been using the following stacks:
- [.NET 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)

For testing, I still plan to use:
- [XUnit](https://xunit.net/);
- [Moq](https://github.com/moq/moq4);
